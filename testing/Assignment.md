**Assignment: Comprehensive API Testing with Mocking**

**Objective**

The objective of this assignment is to develop a robust testing suite for a RESTful API in Go, employing advanced testing techniques such as mocking dependencies, testing HTTP endpoints, and utilizing table-driven tests. You will gain experience in ensuring the reliability and correctness of web applications through effective testing practices.

**Problem Statement**

You are tasked with implementing a simple RESTful API that manages a collection of items (e.g., books, products, etc.). The API should support basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Your primary goal is to create a comprehensive set of tests that validate the functionality of the API, including error handling and edge cases. Additionally, you will use mocking to simulate external dependencies, such as a database or external services, ensuring each test runs in isolation.

**Requirements**

1. **API Implementation:**
    * Create a simple RESTful API with the following endpoints:
        * POST /items: Create a new item.
        * GET /items: Retrieve a list of items.
        * GET /items/{id}: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
        * PUT /items/{id}: Update an existing item by ID.
        * DELETE /items/{id}: Delete an item by ID.
    * Use a simple in-memory data structure to store items (e.g., a slice or a map).
    * **Note** : If you don't want to create new API's , you can make use of exisitng one's available [here](https://github.com/infracloudio/citadel-internal/tree/master/modules/go#final-assignment)
2. **Mocking Dependencies**:
    * Identify dependencies in your API (e.g., database or external service calls).
    * Create mock functions, variables, and objects to simulate these dependencies in your tests.
    * Ensure that your tests do not rely on external systems, allowing them to run quickly and reliably.
3. **Testing HTTP Endpoints:**
    * Write comprehensive tests for each API endpoint using Go's net/http/httptest package.
    * Verify the correctness of responses, including status codes, response bodies, and headers.
    * Handle various scenarios, including success cases, error cases, and edge cases (e.g., invalid input, data not found).
4. **Table-Driven Tests:**
    * Use table-driven tests to organize your test cases, clearly defining inputs and expected outputs for each scenario.
    * Ensure that your tests cover all possible paths through your code, including error handling.
5. **Comprehensive Test Suite:**
    * Create a single test file that contains all your tests, organized logically by functionality.
    * Use assertions to validate outputs, and provide meaningful error messages to aid debugging.
6. **Documentation:**
    * Document your testing strategy and provide comments within your test code explaining the purpose of each test.
    * Include a README file explaining how to run the tests and any dependencies required.
7. **Bonus Features (Optional):**
    * Implement additional features in your API, such as item validation, filtering, or pagination.
    * Write integration tests that test the API against a real database using a test database setup.

**Deliverables**

* Complete source code for the API and all associated test files.
* A README file with instructions on how to run the API and execute the tests.
* Documentation of the testing strategy and any additional features implemented.

**Evaluation Criteria**

* Quality of tests: Are the tests comprehensive, well-structured, and easy to understand? Are mocking techniques used effectively?
* Code quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, and maintainable? Are appropriate Go idioms used?
* Documentation: Is the code adequately documented? Are the instructions clear and easy to follow? Does it have proper comments at appropriate places explaining the implementation of a method.
* Bonus features: If applicable, are the bonus features implemented effectively and seamlessly integrated into the main application?


**Test Coverage Criteria**

The results generated by the ```go cover``` module should at least be 75% to pass which determines that the minium required test cases are covered under this assignment.
